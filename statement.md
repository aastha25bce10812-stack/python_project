# Project Statement: Student Result Management System

## Problem Statement
In many educational settings, managing student academic results can be a manual, error-prone, and time-consuming process. Educators and administrators often struggle with efficiently recording marks, calculating aggregates, determining percentages, assigning grades, and retrieving student information. There is a need for a simple, accessible system to streamline these tasks, reduce administrative overhead, and provide quick access to student performance data.

## Scope of the Project
The Student Result Management System aims to provide a basic, console-based solution for managing student results. It focuses on core functionalities: adding new student records, calculating their performance metrics (total marks, percentage, grade), storing this data persistently, and enabling retrieval through viewing all records or searching by roll number. The system is designed for a single-user environment and does not include advanced features such as user authentication, complex reporting, or graphical user interfaces.

## Target Users
*   **Educators**: Teachers who need to record and manage marks for their students and quickly access their performance data.
*   **School Administrators**: Individuals responsible for maintaining student records and generating basic performance reports.
*   **Students/Parents**: Could potentially use the system (if access is provided) to view their own results, though the current implementation is geared towards administrative use.

## High-Level Features
*   **Student Data Entry**: Ability to input and store student details including Roll Number, Name, and marks for multiple subjects.
*   **Automated Calculations**: Automatic calculation of total marks, percentage, and assignment of grades based on predefined criteria.
*   **Data Persistence**: Storage of all student records in a structured format (CSV file) to ensure data is retained across sessions.
*   **Data Retrieval**: Functions to view a complete list of all student records.
*   **Search Functionality**: Capability to search for individual student records using their unique Roll Number.
